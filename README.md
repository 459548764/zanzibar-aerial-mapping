# Aerial Mapping with Drones & Deep Learning in Zanzibar, Tanzania

## Motivation:

Open source R&D notebooks of all the steps (deep learning and otherwise) to create a state of the art deep learning building detector & classifier from high-resolution aerial/drone imagery. Something like this:

## Background:

https://blog.werobotics.org/2018/08/06/welcome-to-the-open-ai-tanzania-challenge/

> Maps are absolutely essential for decision support. Knowing where buildings are located is a fundamental input for urban planning, public safety, public health, disaster response, environmental protection, sustainable development and census data, for example. Some of these applications typically require timely and high-resolution maps.

> Take the following scenario: a local organization that provides low-cost solar panels to low-income households in rural Tanzania is evaluating a large neighborhood with many small houses. They have to determine how to best optimize the installation and distribution of their panels. So they need to know which of the residential structures are oriented in a way that makes them more suitable for solar panels. Knowing where these small houses are and what their orientation is vis-a-vis the sun and surrounding trees, what their roofs look like to determine where to place the panels, and what materials the roofs are made of are all key inputs for their planning. This is just one of many applications for high-resolution maps.

> Open AI Tanzania â€” is a partnership with our friends at the State University of Zanzibar (SUZA), WeRobotics, World Bank, OpenAerialMap and Tanzania Flying Labs. Open AI Tanzania invites data scientists to develop feature detection algorithms that can automatically identify buildings and building types using high-resolution aerial imagery collected by Tanzanian drone pilots through the Zanzibar Mapping Initiative (ZMI). The goal of this challenge is to correctly segment and classify building footprints under various stages of construction.
